Consumer driven contract test using Pact
########################################
Sample project to set up contract testing using `python implementation <https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-python>`_ of `pact <https://docts.pact.io>`_.

In this example the Consumer is LoginService and the provider is UserService, both in the same repository for simplicity.

Run contract tests in consumer service
--------------------------------------
The first part of contract testing is to run the tests on the consumer side in order to generate the pact files,
they are similar to unit tests with the difference that they use a mock service provided by pact
and generate the pact files:

::

$ cd login_service
$ docker-compose up --build

It will run the contract tests in a container and put the resulting pact files in:
**consumer-driven-contract/pacts**

Verify pacts in the provider service
------------------------------------
Now we have to verify that the actual provider service satisfies the contract generated by the consumer,
in this example we use a docker pact verifier:

::

$ cd user_service
$ docker-compose up --build

Verify results.
